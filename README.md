# Welcome

Welcome to Fskin.Fun, the decentralized finance protocol transforming how we interact with **Steam Market items**, especially **CS2 cases and skins**. Leveraging Web3 technology, Fskin.Fun brings liquidity, transparency, and innovative financial use cases to the gaming world by tokenizing these items on the blockchain.

### Why Fskin.Fun?

Fskin.Fun exists to expand the possibilities for Steam items beyond traditional trading. By tokenizing these assets, we enable **decentralized trading, enhanced liquidity, and new financial applications**, creating opportunities for both gamers and DeFi enthusiasts. With Fskin.Fun, you can turn your Steam items into ERC20 tokens (for CS cases) and ERC721 NFTs (for CS skins), unlocking liquidity and potential earnings while keeping the option to redeem items anytime.

#### What You’ll Find Here

In this documentation, you’ll find everything you need to know about Fskin.Fun’s protocol, from asset handling to using our minting, redemption, and trading features. Here’s a quick overview of Fskin.Fun’s core components and how they benefit you:

1. **Transparency and Asset Management**
   * Fskin.Fun uses multiple public Steam accounts as our asset vaults. All accounts are publicly visible, and each is linked to Fskin.Fun with a verifiable signature. This ensures transparency and security for all users.
2. **Minting and Redemption**
   * Through our user-friendly minting and redemption interface, users can connect both their Steam and Web3 wallets.
   * Mint your CS cases into ERC20 tokens or CS skins into ERC721 NFTs, which can be redeemed at any time back into the original items.
3. **Oracle for On-Chain Records**
   * Fskin.Fun operates an on-chain Oracle system to log token counts, redemption cooldowns, and other essential data. This record guarantees accurate and reliable asset tracking.
4. **Trading**
   * For ERC20 tokens (representing cases), Fskin.Fun provides liquidity on Uniswap to facilitate trading. Once minted, ERC20 tokens can be traded freely on DEXs, creating opportunities for price discovery and asset utilization.
   * For ERC721 NFTs (representing skins), users receive unique NFTs that can be traded on marketplaces like OpenSea.

### Key Benefits

* **Unlocks Liquidity**: Bring your gaming assets into the DeFi ecosystem, enhancing their value through liquidity and diverse trading options.
