# FAQ

Welcome to the Fskin.Fun FAQ! Here, we address the most commonly asked questions about our platform, services, and tokenization process.

***

#### 1. **What is Fskin.Fun?**

Fskin.Fun is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that tokenizes Steam market items, specifically CS2 cases and skins. We turn CS cases into ERC20 tokens and CS skins into ERC721 NFTs, making it possible for users to trade these items on decentralized exchanges, add liquidity, and explore new financial opportunities.

#### 2. **How does tokenization work on Fskin.Fun?**

Tokenization at Fskin.Fun involves converting your Steam market items (such as CS cases and skins) into blockchain-based assets:

* **CS Cases** are minted as ERC20 tokens, representing fungible assets.
* **CS Skins** are minted as ERC721 NFTs, representing unique, non-fungible assets.

Once tokenized, these items can be traded, staked, or used in various DeFi applications while remaining redeemable for the original item.

#### 3. **Why would I tokenize my Steam items?**

Tokenizing your Steam items enables you to:

* **Unlock liquidity**: Trade your CS cases and skins freely on decentralized exchanges.
* **Reduce market fees and restrictions**: Avoid some of the limitations and fees on Steam’s market.
* **Participate in DeFi**: Use your tokenized assets in decentralized finance applications, from trading to lending, with new financial opportunities.

#### 4. **How do I mint tokens on Fskin.Fun?**

To mint tokens, follow these steps:

1. Visit [Fskin.fun](https://fskin.fun).
2. Connect both your Web3 wallet and Steam account.
3. Select the items you wish to tokenize.
4. Confirm the transaction. Fskin.Fun will request a trade offer through Steam, and once completed, we’ll mint the corresponding tokens to your Web3 wallet.

#### 5. **How do I redeem my tokenized assets?**

To redeem assets:

1. Visit [Fskin.fun](https://fskin.fun).
2. Connect your Web3 wallet and Steam account.
3. Choose the ERC20 or ERC721 tokens you wish to redeem.
4. Confirm the burn transaction. Fskin.Fun will verify the burn, then send a trade offer to your Steam account for redemption.

#### 6. **What are the fees?**

Fskin.Fun charges a **0.1% protocol fee on redemptions**. This fee supports the platform’s development and operational costs.

#### 7. **Is my Steam account secure when connected to Fskin.Fun?**

Yes, Fskin.Fun uses secure connections to ensure the safety of both your Steam and Web3 wallets. Your Steam account’s visibility is set to “Public” only to validate ownership and enable vault management without compromising security.

#### 8. **Can I trade my tokenized items on other platforms?**

Yes! Once your CS cases are converted to ERC20 tokens, they can be traded on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. CS skins, minted as ERC721 NFTs, can be freely traded on NFT marketplaces like OpenSea.

#### 9. **What happens if I encounter an issue during minting or redemption?**

If you face any issues, please contact our support team through our official channels or email us at support@fskin.fun. Our team will assist you to ensure a smooth minting or redemption process.

#### 10. **Are there any risks associated with tokenizing my items?**

As with any DeFi protocol, Fskin.Fun carries some risk, such as fluctuations in token prices on exchanges. Additionally, since tokenized items are now part of a decentralized financial market, there may be value volatility and liquidity changes.

#### 11. **What is Fskin.Fun’s Oracle system?**

Our Oracle system records key data like token quantities and redemption cooldowns directly on the blockchain. This data helps ensure accuracy, transparency, and reliability for users’ tokenized assets.

#### 12. **How does Fskin.Fun maintain transparency?**

All Steam accounts used as Fskin.Fun vaults are public and linked to the protocol through verified signatures. This transparency enables users to trust in the assets backing their tokens.
